# Blender_proj
This is the file where i save my blender projects. And also, this will be my progress check almost for every week if not daily.
This will include all of the progress that i will make during the making of game that i am thinking to complete if not launch before i get placed in any company or startup.
This repository will contain all the terrain and other stuff that i will make in blender.
My first project was made on 27/12/2022 - Snowy Canyon.
Names given to objects or files in this project may sometime does not resemble the item inside of it.
